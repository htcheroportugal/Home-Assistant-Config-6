<p align="left">I have used Hassio with standard Add-On store packages which include Appdaemon for use with HaDashboard, Mosquitto Broker for MQTT Broker & Node-RED for more complex Automation flows.</p>

<h4 align="left">Home Assistant:</h4>
<p align="left">As I am still new to Home Assistant (and always learning), I decided to install HASSIO. I have been using HASSIO since December 2017, for anyone new to HA I recommend this type of installation and once you are more comfortable with it I would then look to move onto some of the other methods of installation.</p>
<h4 align="left">MQTT Broker:</h4>
One of the first things I needed to do once I got HA up and running was to setup a MQTT Broker, I decided to use CloudMQTT(https://www.cloudmqtt.com/) as I found this really helpful guide from BRUH(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaWdvVVYU3A) and was up and running in 15mins. The main problem I had with this method was using a cloud based service to control my mqtt based light switches. I decided to install Mosquitto Broker from the Hass.io Add-On Store. Doing this means I can host the MQTT Broker locally therefore having control of who can access my devices and data.
<h4 align="left">AppDaemon3 - HADashboard:</h4>
I have a bunch of wall mounted tablets (Android & IOS) aswell as RPi with 7" touchscreens and whilst I like the standard HA UI there is way too much going on for my wife and guests who need to interact with the smart home system. In cometh HADashboard, It wraps up your basic controls (lights, cooling, heating, music etc) into nice looking widgets that make using the smart home controls a breeze for any non tech person in the house (everyone but me). 
<h4 align="left">Node-RED:</h4>
After using HA for a few months I began to really enjoy the sometimes complicated methods of using automations, I also came to realise some of the limitations in its implementations. I found a really good repo with an easy to follow installation guide by NotoriousBDG here (https://github.com/notoriousbdg/hassio-addons/tree/master/node-red) this handles any of my more complicated flows and conditioning required for my Automations.

<h3 align="left">Kingia Castle Network</h3>
<img src="https://github.com/JamesMcCarthy79/Home-Assistant-Config/blob/master/HA%20Pics/Network%20Topo.png"/>
<p align="left">My Internet is a 100/40Mb/s FTTN solution where the fibre is terminated about 50m up the road and travels down phones lines (VDSL2+) for the remainder I typically acheive speeds of 92/35Mb/s. The core of my network switching devices are made up of Mikrotik Cloud Router Series, whilst my wireless network is comprised of both Altai and UBNT devices. I use a VPN and isolate my Smart Home devices from my Personal and Guest access networks through VLAN's and client isolation is implimented on the guest network.</p>

<h4 align="left">Core Router:</h4>
<p align="left">My Core Router handles my PPPoE authentication, NAT and firewall rules. All of my remote access is handled by a build it Cloud DNS service on the Mikrotik Router along with an extensive list of non standard port forwards to gain access to every device I can remotley. I previously used the Mikrotik Device Tracker platform for online/offline status but found the response time too long so instead now use the Ping platform for device status monitoring.</p>
<h4 align="left">Core Switch:</h4>
<p align="left">My Core Switch is just a managed GBit Switch all of my ethernet connected devices connect to this via Cat6 in wall Cabling into Cat6 Wall plates and all use Cat6 Patch Cables.</p>
<h4 align="left">Wireless Access:</h4>
<p align="left">I have 4 SSID one for each of admin access, family access, guest access & smart home device access. I used to run a Cambium cnPilot E400 which I was given by Cambium for testing in a "Conference Environment" it was meant to be able to handle 100 similtaneous youtube streams well it started to fall over after about 35 connected clients (not streaming anything). Rather then filling the house with several APs I decided to go for the best in the business and am using a single Altai AP which is capable of handling 512 clients (currently have over 70 and still going strong). I only use 2.4G for access and have the 5G radio turned off as I use that spectrum for backhaul.</p>
<h4 align="left">Wireless PTMP Links:</h4>
<p align="left">I have a few impossible to cable areas of my 2 storey house (without running external ducting), between upstairs and downstairs and the outer wall of the downstairs area (where my media room is located). I have used a 19DBi UBNT NBE in AP mode connected directly to my Core Switch which links on 40Mhz channel to a unit in my media room and another upstairs which feeds into a Mikrotik switch that connects any ethernet devices upstairs</p>
<h4 align="left">Network Management:</h4>
<p align="left">I use mikrotik for network configuration due to its highly configurable nature but it has a steep learning curve. I use these as I have been working with the product for over 12 years and am comfortable with it. I use winbox to access Mikrotik devices and prefer to do any configurations via the CLI but the products do have a Web UI which is usable for most functions.</br> 

UBNT devices are configured by their Web UI and then managed by a CRM Point Device (overkill for 3 devices) they have been set and forget with only firmware upgrades performed if they address any security patches.</br> 

Altai AP is configured by its Web UI, these are commercial APs and are not designed with end users in mind. The UI is unpolished and hard to navigate if you dont understand wireless and it is meant for wireless networking engineers. It is again highly configurable although there is nothing really special here just 4 SSID (capable of up to 32) and VLAN tagging for each.</br>

The big bonus with Altai is their antenna design and ability to cover a great distance with a single AP and the amount of simultaneous connected clients it can handle. In my place so far I have tried Mikrotik (coverage is poor due to low power and antenna design), UBNT (poor client handling and very susceptible to interference), Cambium (poor coverage and client handling was better than UBNT but not enough), Ruckus (great coverage poor client and roaming handover without controller)</p>

<h3 align="left">Voice Control & TTS</h3> 
<img src="https://github.com/JamesMcCarthy79/Home-Assistant-Config/blob/master/HA%20Pics/alexa.png" width="150"/> 
<p align="left">The voice control war has only just hit Australian shores, I dipped my toes into the Alexa waters a few years back with the original Echo and it was a bit of a flop due to nothing being supported in Australia. Once I moved to HA and its Amazon cloud component I dusted off the Echo and now have voice control over a majority of my Smart Home.</p>

<h4 align="left">Voice Control:</h4>
<p align="left">I use a combination of Amazon Echo and Echo Dot's in conjunction with HA Cloud with its Alexa Intergration to enable voice control over most functions in the house. My wife hates the voice control (she wants to be the only female voice of control in our house) but my young boys love it.</p>
* Light Control - LED Strips, Wall Switches and Bulb specific (Brightness, Colour, Warmth etc)</br>
* Climate Control - Control Upstairs/Downstairs Climate (temp up/down etc) turn ceiling fans on off (no speed control yet)</br>
* Media Control - Turn on/off Media Devices, player control of Kodi Media</br>
* Group Control - I can turn on/off all devices in a group e.g. "Alexa, turn off Downstairs" as we go to bed turns off all devices</br>
* Scene Selection - Enable predinfined scenes with voice command</br>
* Automation Control - Perharps the best part the ability to toggle Automations "Turn on Morning Cartoons", &nbsp; "Turn on Entertaining mode"</br>
<h4 align="left">Announcements TTS</h4>
<p align="left">For TTS I use a combination of Kodi devices (I have one always on downstairs) and Android tablets with Lannouncer. I love the TTS and notifier component this is where you can staret to give your Smart Home some personality aswell as keep informed of events & reminders. I also use it for feed back after certain actions like confirmation of fan speed settings.</p>
* Notify of Presence - Unique messages played upon my wife and I arrival home</br>
* Notify of Tasks - Msg played when washer/dryer have finished their respective cycles, with 30min reminders until emptied</br>
* Reoccurring Events - Reminder msg to take out bins night before rubbish collection day, with alt msg for recycling week</br>
* Warning Events - Notify of Alarm Trigger, Arming, Outdoor Motion, Smoke/C02 Detection</br>
* Automation Notify - Notify on certain Automation runs like when sun is above horizon and lights are still on I turn them off &nbsp; &nbsp; and have TTS play a message "I guess I better turn the lights off or Tina will leave them on all day"
