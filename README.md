<p align="left">I have used Hassio with standard Add-On store packages which include Appdaemon for use with HaDashboard, Mosquitto Broker for MQTT Broker & Node-RED for more complex Automation flows.</p>

<h4 align="left">Hassio:</h4>
<p align="left">As I am still new and always learning to Home Assistant, I decided to install HASSIO. I have been using HASSIO for since December 2017 for anyone new to HA I recommend this type of installation and once you are more comfortable with it I would look to move onto some of the other methods of installation.</p>
<h4 align="left">MQTT Broker:</h4>
One of the first things I needed to do once I got HA up and running was to setup a MQTT Broker, I decided to use CloudMQTT(https://www.cloudmqtt.com/) as I found this really helpful guide from BRUH(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VaWdvVVYU3A) and was up and running in 15mins. The main problem I had with this method was using a cloud based service to control my mqtt based light switches, using Owntracks for Device Tracking was also not what was required for Automations based of presence. I decided to install Mosquitto Broker from the Hass.io Add-On Store. Doing this means I can host the MQTT Broker locally therefor having control of who can access my devices and data.
<h4 align="left">AppDaemon3 - HADashboard:</h4>
I have a bunch of wall mounted tablets (Android & IOS) aswell as RPi with 7" touchscreens and whilst I like the standard HA UI there is way too much going on for my wife and guests who need to interact with the smart home system. In cometh HADashboard, It wraps up your basic controls (lights, cooling, heating, music etc) into nice looking widgets that make using the smart home controls a breeze for any non tech person in the house (everyone but me). 
<h4 align="left">Node-RED:</h4>
After using HA for a few months I began to really enjoy sometimes complicated methods of using automations, I also came to realise some of the limitations in its implementations. I found a really good repo with an easy to follow installation guide by NotoriousBDG here (https://github.com/notoriousbdg/hassio-addons/tree/master/node-red) this handles any of my more complicated flows and conditioning required for my Automations.

<img src="https://github.com/JamesMcCarthy79/Home-Assistant-Config/blob/master/HA%20Pics/Network%20Topo.png"/>
<p align="left">My Internet is a 100/40Mb FTTN solution where the fibre is terminated about 50m up the road and travels down phones lines (VDSL2+) for the remainder I typically acheive speeds of 92/35Mb/s. The core of my network switching devices are made up of Mikrotik Cloud Router Series, whilst my wireless network is comprised of both Altai and UBNT for dedicated PTP links. I use a VPN and isolate my Smart Home devices from my Personal and Guest access networks through VLAN's and client isolation is implimented on the guest network.</p>
